Release Notes for Curry2Go
==========================

Release notes for version 1.4.0 (July 17, 2024)
-----------------------------------------------

  * Command `:interface` use the new interface pretty printer
    based on the Curry package `curry-interface` so that also
    information about type classes are shown
  * Update front end:
    - new option `--origin-pragmas` (only for use in the Curry Language Server)
    - incomplete cases are always extended with explicit calls to
      `Prelude.failed` in missing branches. For instance,

          head (x:_) = x

      is translated into the FlatCurry definition

          head xs = case xs of x:_ -> x
                               []  -> Prelude.failed


Release notes for version 1.3.0 (May 23, 2024)
----------------------------------------------

  * Changes in case mode: the case modes Haskell, Prolog, and GÃ¶del
    are stronger so that they emit error messages instead of warnings,
    the default case mode is Curry, which is like Haskell but emit
    only warnings.
  * Front end does not include `Prelude` in imports of FlatCurry files
    when it is not necessary (e.g., if the language option `NoImplicitPrelude`
    is set)


Release notes for version 1.2.0 (November 1, 2023)
---------------------------------------------------

  * Base libraries extended by including libraries for encapsulated search
    so that set functions can be used without installing packages.
    The new libraries are: `Control.Search.SetFunctions`(implementing
    set functions), `Control.Search.AllValues` (implementing a strong
    encapsulation as I/O operations), `Control.Search.Unsafe`
    (implementing strong encapsulation as non I/O operations, but this
    method has a non-declarative behavior), and `Control.Search.SearchTree`
    (implementing search trees which are mainly used in KiCS2 to implement
    encapsulation).


Release notes for version 1.1.0 (February 17, 2023)
---------------------------------------------------

* add debug/trace mode (activated by command `:set +debug`)
  in order to show the individual computation steps and tasks
  (for the fair search strategy)
* Update CPM (with new resource URLs)


Release notes for version 1.0.1 (February 3, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------

* implementation of packages `socket` and `bindata` completed
* new name scheme to avoid name clashes in translated entity names
* raising failures and non-determinism in I/O actions added


Release notes for version 1.0.0 (October 8, 2021)
-------------------------------------------------

Complete distribution, containing the compiler to Go,
the REPL and the Curry Package Manager.
